## Feedback for Kubernetes Contributors session, Bangalore - Feb 20th 2021
* GREAT SESSION!
* Nicely balanced between covering the Kubernetes org structure, process, contributing process, sample demo PR etc.
* One suggestion is to allocate time for "verbal" conversation with attendees too. It was mostly chat based. 
* Looking forward to contribute to Kubernetes and help our community grow further. Cheers !!
