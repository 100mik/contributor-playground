Why Fixing Bugs is a Good start to contribute to Open Source projects
1. There's already code for the project. It's just that there's a small bug and you need to fix it
with some or maybe lots of code.
2. It's very possible that the code has lot of tests, but the existing tests don't catch the bug
due to some reason. So, you have the opportunity to add a new test or modify existing tests to
catch the bug and then fix the issue. This ensures that the bug is not introduced again later by
modifying whatever code you contributed through your PR, which is almost like invalidating your PR
which can be sad for multiple reasons - bug is introduced again, your efforts are kind of reverted etc. 
3. It's nice feeling to fix a bug and alliviate the pain that the bug is causing for the users of the project
4. Having a project with less bugs creates more confidence on the project and you would be a reason for it
